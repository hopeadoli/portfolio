            <p>
              These Standard Terms and Conditions provide the basis for a good
              working relationship between you (the “Client”, “You”) and Hope
              Adoli (“I”). These terms form an integral part of the agreement
              between you and I. The vast majority of design projects run
              smoothly, without any problems. However, from time to time,
              something does come up, and it’s important that we both have an
              understanding of how best to deal with it. These terms and
              conditions are designed to ensure that we’re both protected from
              any unexpected circumstances. It also lays out the basic
              groundwork for how the project will progress, and what’s expected
              of us both. In the interests of saving a lot of headaches, this
              document contains the strict minimum of legal jargon required to
              still be legally enforceable.

          <p className={styles.specialText}>
            By accepting my design proposal, you are considered to have accepted
            these terms and conditions in full.

            <h2>02. What do both parties agree to do?</h2>
            <p>
              2.1 You agree that: <br />
              You have the authority to enter into this contract on behalf of
              yourself, your company or your organization. You agree to provide
              me with everything that I need to complete the project including
              text, images and other information as and when I need it, and in
              the format that I ask for. You’ll review my work and provide
              feedback and approval in a timely manner. Deadlines work two ways,
              so you’ll also be bound by any dates we set together. You also
              agree to stick to the payment schedule set out at the end of this
              contract.
            </p>

            <p>
              2.2 I agree that: <br />I have the experience and ability to
              perform the services you need from me and I will carry them out in
              a professional and timely manner. Along the way I will endeavour
              to meet all the deadlines set but I can’t be responsible for a
              missed launch date or a deadline if you have been late in
              supplying materials or have not approved or signed off my work
              on-time at any stage. On top of this I will also maintain the
              confidentiality of any information that you give me.

          <div id="project-delivery-dates">
            <h2>03. Project delivery dates</h2>

            <p>
              If there is a hard deadline for your project, you must communicate
              it clearly up front before payment is made. It is always my
              intention to complete your project on time. Revisions and your
              response times play a major role in the amount of time it takes to
              complete your project. Therefore, the project completion date I
              give you is not a guarantee.

            <h2>04. Design</h2>
            <p>
              This contract allows for a set number of revisions as stated in
              the proposal. If, at any stage, you’re not happy with the
              direction the work is taking, you’ll pay me in full for everything
              I’ve produced until that point and cancel this contract.
            </p>

          <div id="text-content">
            <h2>05. Text content</h2>
            <p>
              Ideally, I’m not responsible for writing or editing any text copy
              unless specified in the original proposal. You are supposed to
              provide copies to be used. Nevertheles I will provide them incase
              you’re unable to - free of charge.

          <div id="media">
            <h2>06. Photographs and Other Media</h2>
            <p>
              You should supply graphic files in an editable, vector digital
              format. You should supply photographs in a high-resolution digital
              format. If you choose to buy stock photographs, I can suggest
              stock libraries. You should supply videos, audios, GIFs, or any
              other media file that I may need in the course of my work. By
              default, I use royalty-free photos and videos from unsplash.com,
              pexels.com, or pixabay.com in case you’re unable to provide them.
              If you need any advice on these formats, I’m always happy to help.

          <div id="changes-and-revisions">
            <h2>07. Changes and Revisions</h2>
            <p>
              All changes and revisions will need written approval in some form.
              If changes are given via a phone call, they will need to be
              confirmed in writing in an email and given the OK.
            </p>
            <p>
              Experience shows that fixed-price contracts aren’t always
              beneficial to you, as they can limit you to your earliest ideas. I
              don’t want to limit your ability to change your mind. The price at
              the beginning of this contract is based on the scope of the work,
              as well as the length of time I estimate I’ll need to accomplish
              everything you’ve told me you want to achieve, plus up to 3 major
              revisions. But I’m happy to be flexible. If you want to change
              your mind or add anything new, that won’t be a problem, as I’ll
              provide a separate cost for that.

          <div id="feedback">
            <h2>08. Making the Most of Changes and Revisions</h2>
            <p>
              You must be specific with your feedback. If you are requesting
              revisions, it is most effective to point. Excessive revisions,
              tweaks, and miscellaneous changes are subject to additional
              charges at my discretion.
            </p>
            <p>
              Errors in text or formatting that I have introduced into your
              content will be fixed for free. However, any other edits such as
              typo/grammatical errors/wording changes carried over from the
              original copy may be subject to additional charges.
            </p>
            <p>
              I am not responsible for revisions or updates to a project once
              the final agreed-upon deliverable has been sent. If additional
              design or edits associated with this project are needed, a new
              project agreement will be created.
            </p>

          <p className={styles.specialText}>
            Once you approve a design, it’s considered final.

            <h2>09. Project Cancellation</h2>
            <p>
              Should something happen for any reason whatsoever that causes you
              to cancel this project once it has begun, you are completely free
              to do so. You will simply be billed for any work completed up to
              the point of cancellation, and I will send you any work completed
              up to that point.
            </p>
            <p>
              Should some life-altering event happen to cause me to cancel this
              project, I will hand over any work completed up to the point of
              cancellation and refund you for any payments made on incomplete
              work.

          <div id="severability">
            <h2>10. Severability</h2>
            <p>
              I can’t guarantee that my work will be error-free, and so I can’t
              be liable to you or any third party for damages, including lost
              profits, lost savings, or other incidental, consequential, or
              special damages, even if you’ve advised me of them. Finally, if
              any provision of this contract shall be unlawful, void, or for any
              reason unenforceable, then that provision shall be deemed
              severable from this contract and shall not affect the validity and
              enforceability of any remaining provisions.

          <div id="copyright">
            <h2>11. Copyright</h2>
            <p>
              First, you guarantee that all elements of text, graphics, photos,
              designs, trademarks, or other artwork you provide are either owned
              by your good selves or that you have permission to use them.
            </p>
            <p>
              Then, when your final payment has cleared, copyright will be
              automatically assigned as follows: You’ll own the visual elements
              that I create for this project. I’ll give you source files and
              finished files, and you should keep them somewhere safe as I’m not
              required to keep a copy. You own all elements of text, images, and
              data you provided, unless someone else owns them.
            </p>
            <p>
              I’ll own the unique combination of these elements that constitutes
              a complete design, and I’ll license that to you, exclusively and
              in perpetuity for this project only, unless we agree otherwise.
            </p>
            <p>
              I love to show off my work and share what I’ve learned with other
              people, so I reserve the right, unless you specifically ask me not
              to, to display and link to your project as part of my portfolio
              and to write about it on websites, in magazine articles, and in
              books.

              anything which I deem to be immoral, offensive, obscene, or
              illegal. All material must conform to all standards laid down by
              relevant laws and authorities. I also reserve the right to refuse
